## Who

👋🏻 I’m Anna, a web designer originally from Greece, living in Europe. 🇪🇺

I enjoy challenging myself, learning how to do new things and how to speak other languages. 

### Languages

👄 **Currently fluent in:** English, Greek, German.
📚 **Learning:** Dutch, Japanese.

## What

Here you’ll find various thoughts on **design** and other topics I’m passionate about; **technology**, **drawing**, **languages** and **life** in general.

🏷 Each post is assigned to one or more tags, a.k.a. categories. Click a tag to see all posts in that category or see all categories in the 'all posts' page. 

*You can switch to a dark theme (so much better at night) by pressing the button on the top right.*

## Why

Reading what people similar or very unlike myself write has been something that’s helped me immensely so far. I’d even go as far as to say that many articles I’ve read online have been detrimental to shaping my character and helping me reevaluate my views with a clear head. I love the internet for allowing us all to connect to each other in ways not possible in the past. 

You can go online and learn about anything from anyone. Perhaps some people will find my thoughts interesting and/or learn something by reading about my experiences.
